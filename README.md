- 👋 Hi, I’m @RobertL31
- 👀 I'm a french PhD student interested in almost every computer science field, and actually working mostly on video games and artificial intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust ! May I use it or not, the language is really interesting on a design point of view, as much as on what features should promote a nowadays programming language
- 💞️ I am really interested in collaborating on some project, to get better at diving into new code :)
- 📫 You can email me at com_lor@laposte.net, feel free to join me !
