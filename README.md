- 👀 I’m interested in almost every computer science field, and actually working moslty on video games and artificial intelligence
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust ! May I use it or not, the language is really interesting on a design point of view, as much as on what features should promote a nowadays programming language
- 💞️ I am really interested in collaborating on some project, to get better at diving into new code :)
